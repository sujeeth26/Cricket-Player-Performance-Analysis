# Analysis of T20 Cricket Player Performance

## Project Overview
This project analyzes T20 cricket player performance using data-driven insights and machine learning. The goal is to extract patterns, predict performance, and assist team management in strategic planning and decision-making.

### Objectives
- Conduct statistical analysis on batting, bowling, and fielding performance.
- Clean and preprocess raw data for better analysis.
- Apply machine learning techniques for player classification and performance prediction.
- Use feature engineering to enhance performance metrics.
- Provide actionable insights for team selection and game strategy.

## Data
- **Source**: Kaggle and other reputable cricket databases.
- **Features**: Batting stats, bowling stats, fielding records, match outcomes, and player demographics.
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Handle missing values and standardize data.
  - Remove redundant or irrelevant columns.
  - Perform feature selection using statistical methods.

## Methodology
- **Supervised Learning**:
  - Decision Tree for predicting bowler performance.
  - Logistic Regression for batting performance classification.
- **Unsupervised Learning**:
  - K-Means Clustering for player segmentation.
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Weighted averages for enhanced performance measurement.
- **Advanced Analysis**:
  - Linear Regression for batting performance trends.
  - Decision Tree Regression for bowling efficiency.

## Results
- **Best Performing Models**: Decision Tree and Logistic Regression.
- **Insights**:
  - Identified key performance metrics affecting batting and bowling outcomes.
  - Clustered players into distinct performance categories for strategic selection.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Heatmaps, scatter plots, and bar charts to interpret player strengths and weaknesses.
